[Parallel programming computer course](https://ppc-exercises.cs.aalto.fi/course/aalto2021) 2021 at Aalto. This is an excellent course, covering intrustion parallelism, vectorization, multi-threads,  cache memory, reuse registers,  openmp, memory coalescing, cuda and so on!!!!!!

Introduction:

1. cp exercises: calculate [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). It essentially is a matrix multiplication.
2. is exercises: image segmentation. Find the best way to partition the given figure in two parts: a monochromatic rectangle and a monochromatic background. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors.
3. mf exercises: 2-dimensional median filtering with a rectangular window.
4. so exercises: so4 is merge sort, so5 is quick sort and so6 is radix sort.
5. Others: test code for debugging.
